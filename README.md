# Linear-Regression
Shows how the linear regression algorithm works giving a example using sklearn. It also includes another program that contains equations used in linear regression and shows an example of how the line of best fit is created for prediction

# SimpleLienarRegression
This file is a super simple implimination of using linear regression to predict an output in 2-D. This is more of a template for improvement in creating whatever you want using this outline.
Requirements for this file:
sklearn

# LinearRegressionDemo
This file contains a demo creating a graph with a prediction line from the data you give. Make sure to put in your file path into the pd.read_csv() so it knows what to read. If your looking for the math behind linear regression look for m_gradient and b_gradient inside the gradient_descnet method. Feel free to use the include csv file for your data in this method.
Requirements for this file:
mathplotlib
pandas
